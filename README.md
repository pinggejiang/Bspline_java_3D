# bspline_java_3d

This is a Java version for 3D B-spline registration on medical images(mha).

__Note: the code is for resarch use only, performance is not optimized__

It's a translated and simplified version from C++ project written by Dr. James A. Shackleford from Drexel University. 

usage: 
	javac Bspline_main.java


A more comprehensive implementation of 3D B-spline registration in C++ please find from the open source software ![plastimatch](http://plastimatch.org/)
