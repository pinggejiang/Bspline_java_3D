# bspline_java_3d

This is a Java version for 3D B-spline registration on medical images(mha).

__Note: the code is for resarch use only, performance is not optimized__

It's a translated and simplified version from C++ project written by Dr. James A. Shackleford from Drexel University. Implemention details please refer to
#### Shackleford JA, Kandasamy N, Sharp GC. On developing B-spline registration algorithms for multi-core processors. Physics in medicine and biology. 2010 Oct 12;55(21):6329.
